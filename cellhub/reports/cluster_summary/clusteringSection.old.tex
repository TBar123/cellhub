\section{Cluster dissimilarity}

\subsection{Dissimilarity by gene expression}

The distances between the clusters was assessed using the ``BuildClusterTree'' function in the Seurat package, which ``constructs a phylogenetic tree relating the ``average'' cell from each identity class''.

\subsection{Dissimilarity by cell pair-wise correlation (in reduced dimensions)}

An alternative distance metric is the median pairwise pearson correlation between the cells of each cluster in reduced dimension space (e.g. PCA).

The median pairwise pearson correlations between the cells of each cluster (reduced dimension space) are shown in the table below.
