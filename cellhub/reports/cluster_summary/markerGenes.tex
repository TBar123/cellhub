\section{Identification of cluster marker genes}

Cluster marker genes were identified using the Seurat FindMarkers routine and the \deTest{} test. A summary table containing all of the significant markers for all of the clusters (based on BH adjusted p value) is available separately.

Key parameters are:

\begin{itemize}
\item Differential expression methods: \deTest
\item Testing limited to genes with a fold change of > \threshUse
\item Testing limited to genes detected in a minimum fraction of \minPct{} of cells
\item Conservation factor applied: \conservedFactor
\end{itemize}
