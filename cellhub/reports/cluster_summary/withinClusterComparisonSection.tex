\section{With-in cluster comparison of conditions}

Genes differentially expressed between the conditions within each cluster were identified. Full results are avaliable as a tab delimited text file.

Key parameters are:

\begin{itemize}
\item Conservation factor: \conservedBetweenFactor
\end{itemize}
